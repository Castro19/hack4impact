                <h3>Introductory:</h3>
                <p>This web application is a comprehensive one-stop tool for counselors, students, and faculty at CCC to use when trying to build SEPs, finding completed degrees/almost completed degrees, checking IGETC/CSU-GE completion, and more!</p>
                <br>
                <p>A SEP is a schedule for 2-3 years that outlines a suggested course of study for the individual student based on major, transfer plan, and sequence of courses. Every student at CCC needs a SEP after enrolling, and the website Assist is used to find the courses they need to take based on their transfer university and major. Here is an example of my SEP schedule at CCC.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                The Degree finder feature is a very helpful tool to instantly find what degrees a student will earn based on the classes in their SEP. The tool also finds degrees that are almost completed, lists the leftover required classes, and allows the user to add the class to their SEP with a simple click.</p>

                <h3>Why I built this:</h3>
                <div class="split-section">
                    <div class="left">
                        <h4>Schedule Builder</h4>
                        <p>I created this web application because new students struggle to understand these PDF agreement and it can take them a couple of hours to find what classes to take and when to take them</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>For new students, this process can be very stressful, intimidating, and time-consuming. On average students can take multiple hours to do this by themselves. Counselors can create a SEP for the student, however, it can take 30 minutes to an hour to complete. My application creates the SEP in seconds while providing a friendly UI and offering other helpful features.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="right">
                        <h4>Degree Finder</h4>
                        <p>Students at CCC, also need to apply for degrees during their last year, which can be very time-consuming as they have to go through each major.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Most of my classmates I knew only graduated with 2-3 degrees when they actually earned 5+ degrees because they never checked the other degrees or applied for them. When I was searching for my completed degrees, the process took me about 30 minutes. The feature I implemented in my web application finds the earned degrees instantly, and it also finds the degrees almost completed along with the classes leftover.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This feature helps maximize the number of degrees a student can earn and it has the potential to build the most optimal schedule as it combines transfer requirements, degree requirements, and IGETC/CSU-GE requirements all together.</p>
